# 🛍️ Online Retail Sales Analysis

## 🎯 Business & Project Objectives

Analyze customer transactions to understand purchasing behavior, identify the most profitable products and customers, visualize sales trends, and provide actionable business recommendations.

From a business perspective, this type of analysis can help e-commerce stakeholders:
- Identify the **top-selling products** to prioritize inventory and marketing efforts
- Detect **underperforming markets** to reconsider international strategy
- Understand **customer lifetime value (CLV)** and **segment clients** for better targeting
- Optimize **sales periods and promotions** by analyzing time-based patterns

For example, identifying that 80% of revenue comes from 20% of products (Pareto principle) could lead to **inventory optimization and cost reduction**. Spotting peak purchasing hours/days allows better **ad budget allocation** and **staffing decisions**.

This project is part of my data portfolio demonstrating both **data analysis skills** and **the ability to generate data-driven business insights** using real-world e-commerce data.
